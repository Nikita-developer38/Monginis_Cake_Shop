                Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand locations
                throughout India under
                the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala in the early 1956. Since then, our family has
                combined their
                years of experience with the vision of a community of collaborative shop owners, suppliers and other
                partners working
                together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to what it is today.
                <br>
                In order to achieve this, the family offers franchises to budding entrepreneurs & distributors
                partnering with them to
                ensure success and excellence.
