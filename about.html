                Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand locations
                throughout India under
                the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala in the early 1956. Since then, our family has
                combined their
                years of experience with the vision of a community of collaborative shop owners, suppliers and other
                partners working
                together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to what it is today.
                <br>
                In order to achieve this, the family offers franchises to budding entrepreneurs & distributors
                partnering with them to
                ensure success and excellence.

                    further refinement to the FD&C Act. These federal guidelines state the legal criteria under which
                    food can be processed
                    and are enforced as law.
                    The “Good Manufacturing Practices” implement the Congressional Statute; the FD&C Act. This set of
                    guidelines outlines
                    the types of actions that a food processor must take to manufacture food under clean conditions

                    We at Monginis uphold encourage and try our best to follow the Good Manufacturing practices.

                    Section 110.10, Personnel, states the wearing of insecure jewelry, including rings with stones,
                    pendants, earrings,
                    bobby pins, etc., by persons engaged in food processing is prohibited. This requirement helps
                    protect the food from
                    foreign material adulteration by these decorative materials. Provisions also include no eating, no
                    tobacco use, or no
                    drinking in production areas, as well as a prohibition against the storage of personal articles in
                    the production areas.
                    Section 110.20, Plant and Grounds, states that a food processor must take proper precautions to
                    reduce the potential for
                    contamination of end products, raw materials, or food packaging materials with microorganisms,
                    chemicals, filth, or
                    extraneous material. It requires that where the possibility of product adulteration exists,
                    procedures must be developed
                    to eliminate this potential contamination.
                    Section 110.35, General Maintenance, requires that all poisonous and dangerous cleaning compounds,
                    sanitizing agents,
                    and pesticide chemicals shall be applied and stored so that food or food packaging material
                    contamination is prevented.
                    Section 110.37, Sanitary Facilities and Control, sets forth requirements on plumbing, sewage
                    disposal, and toilet
                    facilities that are necessary to prevent food contamination.
                    Section 110.40, Equipment and Utensils, requires that food processing equipment shall be designed
                    and constructed to
                    preclude the adulteration of food with lubricants, fuel, metal fragments, or any other contaminants.
                    Section 110.80, Production and Process Control, states that all reasonable precautions shall be
                    taken to ensure that
                    production procedures do not contaminate food with filth, harmful chemicals, undesirable
                    microorganisms, or any
                    objectionable material.
                    <br>
                    The key word throughout the GMP guidelines is prevention. The-entire food safety program must be
                    based upon the
                    prevention of the anticipated potential for food contamination.
                    Chemical, microbiological, or extraneous material testing procedures shall be used to identify food
                    contamination that
                    may have occurred and to prevent contaminated foods from being offered for sale to the consumer.
                    As has been stated in the GMPs, food safety is a legal requirement, and food processors can be
                    prosecuted for failure to
                    comply with the FD&C Act and the corresponding GMPs.
